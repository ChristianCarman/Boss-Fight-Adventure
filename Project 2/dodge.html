            You decided to play a bit more defensive and see about making the Golem do all the hard work for you. You plan to avoid most of the Golem's attacks to make it hurt itself.
        </p>
		<p>
			You aren't sure where to make the Golem attack next though it doesn't matter. An unexpected factor appeared, magic. The golem had pierced your body with a spike made from the ground beneath you. Your once beating heart now beats no more with a hole going directly through you back and out your chest.

            You are remembered as a warrior who fought hard to claim the land and your village holds a feast in your honor every year on the day you died as a rememberance to your struggle.
