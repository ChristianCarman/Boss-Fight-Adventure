        <p>
            As you begin to make the final distance towards the boss you begin to ready your sword with a plan to make the first hit. You go in with little knowledge of what to expect from this boss as little to no information has been gathered about them.
        </p>
		<p>
			As you finally get close enough to the boss you can finally see that it looks like a pile of rocks waiting for your sword to slice through it and allow your country to regain  control over this fallen region
		</p>
        <p>
            The once pile of rocks begins to build up into what looks like a human body, a Golem, it has yet to notice you as you are but small and insufficient for it to care. The Golem stands at a height of what you can only imagine to be 50 feet tall, well you are a mere 5'8. You plan to try and hit the Golem in a weak spot but you aren't sure where to hit first.
